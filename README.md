# Project Retired

When Amazon Inspector launched, this project was created in order to provide the custom code required to trigger various actions in Trend Micro's Deep Security when various Inspector raised a finding related to an assessment. 

Over time the Deep Security API has evolved and more features have been added to Amazon Inspector that makes this workflow trivial using the two APIs. Therefore this code has been retired and moved to a separate 'retired' branch.

To help with create the workflow using the latest APIs, please refer to, "[Integrate Deep Security with AWS Services](https://automation.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/article/12_1/integrate-deep-security-with-aws-services?platform=dsaas)" in the Deep Security Automation Center.
